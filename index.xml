      <description>Introduction I was having tons of trouble exporting my blog. The date format used by ox-hugo was not recognized by the TOML parser. Who would have guessed that using other tool an up do date HUGO binary would do the trick.
Procedure Fedora &amp;ndash; which is my distro at the time of writing this post &amp;ndash; makes available through the stable repo an older HUGO binary (v37) which apparently carries along this issue.</description>

      <description>Introduction As a project starts to grow more and more complex communication-wise, we can notice the amount of tools involved under the task management umbrella increasing; since each client and even our own team has a predilection for a certain way of working.

Emacs is super useful as a task planner through org-mode, and the question is &amp;ldquo;how can we avoid context switching from email to org?</description>
