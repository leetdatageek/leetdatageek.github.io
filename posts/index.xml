      <description> Introduction I was having tons of trouble exporting my blog. The date format used by ox-hugo was not recognized by the TOML parser. Who would have guessed that using other tool would do the trick.
Procedure It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as adding #+hugo_front_matter_format: yaml to the beginning of the file.
Conclusion Sometimes the small things matter. Keep this little snippet in high regard.

      <description>Introduction As a project starts to grow more and more complex communication-wise, we can notice the amount of tools involved under the task management umbrella increasing; since each client and even our own team has a predilection for a certain way of working. Thankfully email is a funnel we can rely on and use as a way to standarize our own queue. Emacs is super useful as a task planner through org-mode, and the question is &amp;ldquo;how can we avoid context switching from email to org?</description>
